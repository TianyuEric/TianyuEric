### :two_hearts: Hobbies

â€‹		Hi there! I'm a die-hard otaku and gamer. Whenever I have free time, I dive into the latest anime series; it's fantastic to follow the characters through their various adventures in different worlds! I enjoy all kinds of anime, whether it's action-packed, heartwarming everyday stories, or sci-fi mysteries â€“ they all bring me joy and positive energy.

â€‹		In addition to watching anime, I spend a lot of time on Steam, particularly playing strategy games and real-time strategy (RTS) titles. To me, these games aren't just about entertainment; they're like carefully crafted sandboxes that let me unleash my imagination and creativity. Whether it's leading a squad through time-traveling adventures or guiding a civilization from ancient times to the future, I'm fully immersed. Sometimes, I spend hours refining every detail of my strategic plans, and the sense of accomplishment is indescribable.

â€‹		I also love interacting with other players. Whether it's discussing tactics on forums or teaming up for challenges in games, the community aspect is always enjoyable. Sometimes, I follow gaming bloggers to see their takes on new games or learn advanced techniques, which has become an integral part of my gaming life.

â€‹		That's me, a lover of anime and strategy games. If you share similar interests, feel free to chat and maybe even team up in-game!
